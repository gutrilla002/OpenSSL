=head1 NAME

EVP_SIGNATURE-HSS
- The EVP_PKEY Hierarchical signature scheme (HSS) implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<HSS> EVP_PKEY implementation supports Hash-based stateful signature
verification using the HSS scheme described in RFC 8554. HSS uses a tree of
Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS).

=head2 Signature Parameters

The following signature parameters can be set using EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params().
This may be called after 

=over 4

=item "threads" (B<OSSL_SIGNATURE_PARAM_THREADS>) <uint32_t>

Set the number of threads used for signature verification ranging from 1 to 8.
The default value of 1 does not use multithreading.
This can only be used with built-in thread support. Threading must be
explicitly enabled by using OSSL_set_max_threads().

=back

EVP_PKEY_CTX_get_params() is not supported.

=head1 NOTES

The "digest" is not specified as a settable parameter because the both the 
HSS EVP_PKEY and the HSS signature contain this information.
